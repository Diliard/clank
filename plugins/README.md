# Plugin API

Clank has an extensive plugin/scripting API that implements the Lua programming language as an interface for hooking into and modifying how events are handled.

## Why Lua?

Lua is a simple and lightweight language that has a low entry-barrier for those who are interested in modding/creating customizable events especially for games that utilize P2S2P DME gameplay. It is also widely used in many games as a scripting/modding language.

## How to run a plugin?

The plugin must be within the `plugins` folder and the file path must either be in the `load_plugin` string array in a Clank JSON configuration file, or it can be loaded on-the-fly via the `plugin load <file>` CLI command.
